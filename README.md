# RC Car Simulation

## Project Information
This is a console-based simulator for RC cars. It is testing if the car can execute a specific order of movments without hitting the walls of the room. The user types the dimensions of the room, car starting position and direction, and movment commands. The program was built in Visual Studio.


## Assumptions

1. Room length and height must be bigger than 0.
2. The car must start inside the room
3. Commands are case-insensitive, both `F` and `f` are valid for moving forward.    
4. The program is a single run, after one execution the user must restart to run another simulation.
